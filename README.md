CTF Gameserver
==============


This is a Gameserver for [attack-defense (IT security) CTFs](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/). It is used for
hosting [FAUST CTF](https://www.faustctf.net), but designed to be re-usable for other competitions. It is
scalable to large online CTFs, battle-tested in many editions of FAUST CTF, and customizable for other
competitions.

For documentation on architecture, installation, etc., head to [ctf-gameserver.org](https://ctf-gameserver.org/).

What's Included
---------------
The Gameserver consists of multiple components:

* Web: A [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)-based web application for team registration, scoreboards,
  and simple hosting of informational pages. It also contains the model files, which define the database
  structure.
* Controller: Coordinates the progress of the competition, e.g. the current tick and flags to be placed.
* Checker: Place and retrieve flags and test the service status on all teams' Vulnboxes. The Checker Master
  launches Checker Scripts, which are individual to each service.
* Checkerlib: Libraries to assist in developing Checker Scripts. Currently, Python and Go are supported.
* Submission: Server to submit captured flags to.
* VPN Status: Optional helper that collects statistics about network connectivity to teams.

Related Projects
----------------
There are several alternatives out there, although none of them could really convince us when we started the
project in 2015. Your mileage may vary.

* [ictf-framework](https://github.com/shellphish/ictf-framework) from the team behind iCTF, one of the most
  well-known attack-defense CTFs. In addition to a gameserver, it includes utilities for VM creation and
  network setup. We had trouble to get it running and documentation is generally rather scarce.
* [HackerDom checksystem](https://github.com/HackerDom/checksystem) is the Gameserver powering RuCTF. The
  first impression wasn't too bad, but it didn't look quite feature-complete to us. However, we didn't really
  grasp the Perl code, so we might have overlooked something.
* [saarctf-gameserver](https://github.com/MarkusBauer/saarctf-gameserver) from our friends at saarsec is
  younger than our Gameserver. It contains a nice scoreboard and infrastructure for VPN/network setup.
* [EnoEngine](https://github.com/enowars/EnoEngine) by our other friends at ENOFLAG is also younger than
  our solution.
* [CTFd](https://ctfd.io/) is the de-facto standard for [jeopardy-based CTFs](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/).
  It is, however, not suitable for an attack-defense CTF.

Another factor for the creation of our own system was that we didn't want to build a large CTF on top of a
system which we don't entirely understand.

Development
-----------
For a local development environment, set up a [Python venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or
use our [dev container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) from
`.devcontainer.json`.

Then, run `make dev`. Tests can be executed through `make test` and a development instance of the Web
component can be launched with `make run_web`.

We always aim to keep our Python dependencies compatible with the versions packaged in Debian stable.
Debian-based distributions are our primary target, but the Python code should generally be
platform-independent.

Security
--------
Should you encounter any security vulnerabilities in the Gameserver, please report them to us privately.
