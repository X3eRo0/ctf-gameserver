## What Exactly is an Attack & Defense CTF?

In an **Attack & Defense CTF**, each participating team hosts identical vulnerable services. Your objectives are:

* **Defend**: Patch and protect your own services against incoming attacks.
* **Attack**: Find and exploit vulnerabilities in other teams' services to capture flags.

Your overall score reflects how well you manage these dual responsibilities: successfully defending your services and capturing flags from your opponents.

## Recommended Team Structure

In this CTF, each team member will juggle multiple tasks-writing exploits, patching services, and even stealing other teams' exploits (assuming we get PCAPs working in time). We recommend forming teams of **3–4 members** to maximize both effectiveness and fun. Suggested responsibilities include:

* Monitoring and protecting your infrastructure, patching vulnerabilities, and maintaining service uptime.
* Developing exploits, discovering vulnerabilities, and interacting with other teams' vulnboxes.
* Managing VPN connections, tracking scores, and handling logistics and overall strategy.

We encourage teams to bring together members with diverse skill sets.
