I have an update for Academy CTF. I want everyone who will be participating in Academy CTF to register themselves on this spreadsheet.
You can pick a cool name for your team (and a logo for the site), list your teammates and pick who 
will be hosting the vulnbox. I will help that person in hosting the vulnbox.

What's a vulnbox?
Vulnbox is nothing but the virtual machine that will be connected to the game infrastructure and it
will run all the docker containers for all services (challenges), each team will receive 1 vulnbox
and someone in the team needs to host it. By hosting I mean, importing it into virtual box and running
a vpn that you share with your teammates such that your teammates can also access this VM. During the
competition you guys would need to run your exploits, patch the running services from this Vulnbox
so, its very important for all members of the team to be able connect to the VM.

Once the teams are figured out, I will release the vulnbox so everyone can test their VPNs and access to your vulnboxes.

The tentative date for the competition is August 16th and it will run for 12 hours. Timing will be updated later.
